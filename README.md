# Braguia - Android Tourism Guide App

**Software development course project**

Braguia is an Android application designed for tourists, offering both standard and premium user experiences. Key features include:

* **Location Tracking & Routes:** Background location monitoring with Android Service, Google Maps navigation, and route history tracking.
* **Points of Interest (POI):** Notifications when near POIs with shortcuts to detailed POI info (location, gallery, media, etc.).
* **User Features:** Route start/stop, offline media access, user authentication, emergency contact, and Google Maps navigation with voice assistance.
* **Premium Access:** Exclusive media downloads, enhanced navigation, and content viewing.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Responsive design, intuitive settings, and offline functionality.

Non-functional requirements ensure stability, offline usage, and adherence to Google's core app quality guidelines.

We were tasked with developing the project using both React Native and Java Native to explore the differences between these two technologies. This comparison allows us to understand their performance, flexibility, and how they handle platform-specific features in Android app development. React Native offers a cross-platform approach, while Java Native focuses solely on Android development, providing deeper access to native APIs and system resources. The project highlights these contrasts in terms of development speed, user experience, and maintainability.
